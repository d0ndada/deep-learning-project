# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNNs

## Project Overview
This project explores **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The primary objective was to design, train, and evaluate multiple CNN architectures to analyze their effectiveness in distinguishing between 10 different image categories.

## Approach
- Implemented and compared **multiple CNN architectures** to find an optimal model.
- Experimented with **batch normalization, data augmentation, and different optimizers** to improve accuracy.
- Evaluated models based on **test accuracy, loss curves, and qualitative error analysis**.
- Focused on understanding **how different CNN structures impact performance**.

## Key Findings
- A **baseline CNN** achieved around **75% accuracy**.
- Optimizations, including **batch normalization and advanced training techniques**, improved accuracy to **85%+**.
- Certain classes in CIFAR-10 were more challenging to classify, highlighting areas for further improvement.
- **Model complexity vs. training time** was a key trade-off observed in deeper architectures.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of CNNs for **image classification** and emphasized the impact of **architecture choices and training strategies** on model performance. Further improvements could involve **transfer learning with pre-trained models** or **fine-tuning hyperparameters** for even higher accuracy.
